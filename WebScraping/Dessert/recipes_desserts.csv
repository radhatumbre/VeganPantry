Do not move the knife back and forth. Use force when cutting. If you cut too slow, the dough will crack. Carefully Arrange the slices 1 inch apart on baking sheet. Bake the cookies for 10-14 minutes, their edges will be golden brown. Let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheet and then VERY carefully transfer to a cooling rack. These cookies are very fragile, so be gentle with them.']",166 kcal,30,https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slice-N-Bake-Vanilla-Brown-Butter-Pecan-Cookies…Dipped-in-Chocolate-2.jpg,dessert
