Make the dough. Combine warm water, yeast and brown sugar in a large mixer bowl (I used my stand mixer) and mix on low speed until incorporated. Allow the mixture to sit about 3 minutes or until poofy. Add the pumpkin, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, eggs and melted butter and mix until combined. Gradually mix in the flour until the dough comes together. I used all 4 cups of flour. Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Kneed into a smooth ball. Grease a large bowl and add the dough to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit 1-2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.', '2. Make the filling. Add the softened butter and pumpkin to a bowl and beat together until combined. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla beans (if using) and salt to a another small bowl and mix well, until fully combined.', '3. Grease 2 (9x5) inch bread pans.', '4. Lightly dust a clean surface with flour. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch the dough down and divide the dough in half. Roll each dough section into a rectangle. Spread the pumpkin butter (softened almost to a melted stage) evenly over the two pieces of dough. Spread the brown sugar + cinnamon evenly over the butter and lightly push the brown sugar into the butter. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate over each piece of dough. Starting with the long edge closest to you, carefully roll the dough into a log, keeping it fairly tight as you go. When you reach the edge, pinch along the edge to seal. Repeat with the remaining loaf.', '5. Place the dough rolls in the prepared bread pans. Immediately cover the dough and place in the fridge overnight. Do not let the dough sit at room temperature long or it will start to get very big.', '6. The next morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dough from the fridge while the oven preheats and brush the loaves with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with pumpkin seeds.', '7. Bake for about 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned on top, do not over bake. If the top becomes too brown before the inside is fully cooked, cover the top with foil.', '8.
